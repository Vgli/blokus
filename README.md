blokus in pygame because why not  



## Rules:

Your first piece must be placed in a corner. 
For a two player game, this is restricted to the top-left and bottom-right

All pieces after that must be placed diagonally adjacent to one of your other pieces.
  
You cannot place a piece directly adjacent to any of your other pieces, or overlapping any piece.

Your score is based on the total number of tiles in the pieces you haven't played.  

This version of the game does not give you a bonus for playing the 1-tile last.

  

## Controls:

Place a piece: Enter, or click on top-left of piece on board (sort of)  

Move a piece: arrow keys  

Rotate piece clockwise: x or scroll up  

Rotate piece counterclockwise: z
 or scroll down  
Flip piece: left shift

Change to pieces of size [#]: #
  
Resign/declare no moves remaining: escape twice in a row 
This is based on player position, which is the top-left of a rectangular bounding box on the piece.

## Blokus rules:

Your first piece must be placed in a corner. 
For a two player game, this is restricted to the top-left and bottom-right

All pieces after that must be placed diagonally adjacent to one of your other pieces.
  
You cannot place a piece directly adjacent to any of your other pieces, or overlapping any piece.

Your score is based on the total number of tiles in the pieces you haven't played.  For main rules, see Mattel.
